Updated Cytogenetic Scripts:

Droplist scripts work with an Excel file of patient data (sample ID, patient name, pediatric?, age, tests, hospital, diagnosis, cultures set, drop day, increase drop day, set date, previous/new, sample type) and are dependent on the day the patient data file was created. The scripts now include automated date list for the dropdown of the day slides were created.

Slide loader scripts parse patient name, sample type, and cultures from the droplist after dates have been recorded for the day the slides were dropped. These scripts are dependent on the dates in the droplist.

Nomenclature scripts are for converting from cytogenetic nomenclature to BED format and changing nomenclature to whole chromosome and LOH abbreviations.

Quality Slide Making scripts parse droplist data based on quality recorded for slides.
